# Password Workshop
CougarCS 4th Meeting - Password Awareness
# Introduction
Introductory workshop on giving an awareness of how easily passwords can be cracked and how to create better-secured passwords for personal computers, websites, and servers by using John the Ripper. Many people use passwords that are easy for them to remember like "Password", "andyisgreat", or "Blameaaron", but that is what makes you vulnerable to hackers. Today, I will be demonstrating how easy it is to break these simple passwords.
